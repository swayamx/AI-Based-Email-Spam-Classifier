🚀 How It Works

Loads a dataset of labeled messages (Ham or Spam).

Cleans text — lowercasing, removing symbols, and tokenizing.

Extracts features using TF-IDF (term frequency–inverse document frequency).

Trains a Naive Bayes classifier.

Evaluates model accuracy and classification metrics.

Saves trained model to disk for later use in a web app or chatbot.

💬 Interview Write-Up (≈120 words)

During my internship, I developed an AI-based Email Spam Classifier using Python. I learned how to process unstructured text data using NLP techniques, extract features with TF-IDF, and train a supervised machine learning model with Scikit-learn. I experimented with algorithms like Naive Bayes and SVM, compared their accuracy, and optimized preprocessing steps. I also explored model evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score. This project strengthened my understanding of end-to-end ML workflows — from data cleaning to model deployment — and gave me hands-on experience applying AI to solve real-world classification problems.
